# Irrtirer

A project for creating mosaics based on a given set of tiles and a target image.

*The name "Irrtirer" is a playful take on "irregular tile orderer".*

## Motivation and development approach

This project is both a personal challenge and a learning playground. I strive to set my own challenges and find solutions independently. For specific algorithms, especially geometric ones, I sometimes refer to solutions found online. I also collaborate with Copilot, mainly in a reviewer role, to help refine and review my ideas.

I chose this topic because it is complex and allows me to tackle interesting technical problems. Irrtirer serves as a space where I experiment with programming techniques and solutions that I have observed and want to master, all at my own pace.

Additionally, this repository is a place to collect and document useful approaches and patterns. It is also a resource I can share with colleagues to show solutions I have worked on and to help share knowledge.

## Project structure

The application is divided into two parts, with the main focus currently on the frontend:

- [Frontend](./frontend/README.md)
- [Backend](./backend/Irrtirer/README.md)

See the respective README files for more details about each part.
